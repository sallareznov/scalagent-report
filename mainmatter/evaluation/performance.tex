Globally, the project performs very well and handles the scalability imposed by the different parameters.

The applications has been tested using a 64-bits computer, with 8GB of RAM and running Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4210H CPU @ 2.90GHz processor. The global performance may vary depending on the machine it has been tested on.

\section{Particles}
We can go up to more than 37000 particles and the application will run smothly.\\
More than that the application will start quickly and run normally, but refreshing time will start to be visible to the naked eye.

\section{Wator}
For the default environment size (180 x 180) our application can go up to 16000 agents (both sharks and tunas). Default environment size is recommended so both \textit{time-dependent number of fishes} chart and \textit{population chart of fishes} will be rendered correctly.

\section{Hunt}
We didn't reach a performance limit with the hunt application.
