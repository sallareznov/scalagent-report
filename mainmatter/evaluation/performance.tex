\subsubsection{Particles}
We can go up to more than 37000 particles and the application will run smothly.\\
More than that the application will start quickly and run normally, but refreshing time will start to be visible to the naked eye.

\subsubsection{Wator}
For the default environment size (180 x 180) our application can go up to 16000 agents (both sharks and tunas). Default environment size is recommended so both \textit{time-dependent number of fish} chart and \textit{population chart of fiches} will be rendered correctly.
